# 1 - Loading Data Using Python

The next step is to install the required libraries that will facilitate data from Yahoo Finance and FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data).

` $ pip install yfinance pandas-datareader `

We have the Apple EOD stock pricing data in a dataframe containing daily Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) prices, as well as the adjusted close price and volume.

Another way we can download the same data is using the pandas-datareader library that we installed in ` data-readerv2.py `
